About this branch: 
This version add instructions for the use of four buttons of the disolutor chasis, adding that the propells motor can keep it  working by itself pushing one button, 
and stoping it with the pushing of other. To the screw motor  work with the continiuos and  direct pulse of the buttons  "up" and "down",
while it keep it pulsed the button, this one gonna work in one direction or another. 
About the potentiometer, there are details about the analog read because of the original Arduino Mega get burned, so the new one (or temporal replacement) work kind of
different in its analog read.
